                <h3>ACCESSIBILITY, AVAILABILITY, AND AFFORDABILITY OF
                    MENTAL HEALTH AND RESOURCES
                </h3>
                <p><br>Why does this issue need to be discussed?<br><br>
                    Thisrising issue needsto be discussed so that people can understand there's
                    a need forresourcesfor mental health to be accessible, available, and
                    affordable. Resourcesshould be handy so that lives can be saved and people
                    can cope up with their problems because prevention is betterthan cure. The
                    problem in this area is due to:-
                <ul>
                    <li>
                        <p>Financial barriersto mental healthcare are a major deciding factor. The
                            cost of treatment limits accessto mental health services. This creates
                            problemsin furthertwo cases: either people are not able to afford
                            treatment at all orthey are not able to continue treatment.</p>
                    </li>
                    <li>
                        <p>Lack of mental health professionals makesit very hard forsomeone to look for good treatment
                            and assistance. Rural areas have almost no mental healthcare providers whereas, in urban
                            areas, there are long waiting listsin clinics which makes the patients sufferfor months
                            before they get an appointment. Moreover, fewer doctors are choosing mental health as their
                            specialty which is a huge gap between the problem and the solution.
                        </p>
                    </li>
                    <li>
                        <p>Mental health education and awareness are still inadequate in society
                            and people often have the fear being judged if they open up about their
                            problems. Mental illnesses are often hard to recognize which is why they
                            need more awareness. Many people dismiss clinical anxiety as“worrying
                            too much” or depression as“laziness orfatigue”. These problems can be
                            solved if people are educated.
                        </p>
                    </li>
                    <li>
                        <p>The social stigma of mental health conditions prevents people from
                            accessing treatment. At one end, their own beliefs about mental illness can prevent them
                            from acknowledging their illness. On the other end, the risk
                            of being judged by others and facing social discrimination also creates a huge
                            barrier.

                <p><b>How does it affect people’s mental health?</b></p>
                <ul>
                    <li><p>People don’t get the professional help they deserve which forces them to rely on friends for seeking help. Many timesthis can be misleading as none of ourfriends are mental health professionals who can help us effectively.</p></li>
                    <li><p>Many people continue to walk in the path ofself-destruction and choose self-harm and suicide as an option overlife.</p></li>
                    <li><p>They completely isolate themselvesfrom society and start living in
                        constantsolitude which can affect their mental health more in a negative
                        way.
                        </p></li>
                    <li><p>This leads to a lack of concentration, productivity and leads to more
                        lethargy and numb feeling.</p></li>
                    <li><p>Patients of mental illness become victims of low self-esteem and
                        under confidence.</p></li>
